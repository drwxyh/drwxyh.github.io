## An Efficient Dynamic Ridesharing Algorithm
> **Dynamic Taxi Ridesharing Problem** is defined as follows: given a set of taxis Taxi on the roadnetwork G and a new incoming request $$tr_new$$ , find the taxi taxi $$\in$$ Taxi that can get the maximum average satisfaction.

### Overview
#### Definition
- Definition 1 (Road Network)：
	- $$G = (V, E, W)$$ consists of a vertex set V and an edge set E
	- o, d represent the staring point and the ending point in the road network

- Definition 2 (Trip Request):
	- denote as $$tr = (t, 0, d, wp, wd, det, r, cnt)$$
	- varible definition:
		- `t`: timestamp
		- `o`: pickup point
		- `d`: destination point
		- `wp`: the time interval when the passenger needs to be picked up at the pickup point
		- `wd`: the time interval when the passenger needs to be droped off at the destination point
		- `det`: detour distance/time that passenger can tolerate, using the shortest path
		- `r`: the ratio for time window in this request
		- `cnt`: indicate the passenger count in this request

- Definition 3 Taxi Schedule:
	- $$S = (v_1, v_2,\cdots,v_{2n})$$ is a temporally ordered sequence of pickup and destination points of n trip requests $$(tr_1, tr_2,\cdots,tr_n)$$.

- Definition 4 Valid Taxi Schedule:
	1. **Orderness**: pickup point must happen before its destion point
	2. **Waiting time constraint**: must not exceed the pickup or drop off time constraint
	3. **Detour distance constraint**: must not exceed the distance constraint
	4. **Passenger number constraint**: the number of passengers muat not exceed the taxi capacity

- Definition 5 Slack Time:
	- **Definition**: $$ST_{V_i} = T_{lateV_i}-T_{arriveV_i}$$
	- $$T_{lateV_i}$$: the latest allowed arrival time
	- $$T_{arriveV_i}$$: the actual arrival time

- Definition 6 Service Rate:
	- the fraction of the trip request that are satisfied

- Definiton 7 Satisfaction:<br>
	$$Sa_{tr} = tr(r)\frac{ST_{tr(o)}+ST_{tr(d)}}{tr(wp)+tr(wd)}+(1-tr(r))\frac{tr(det)-detour}{tr(det)}$$
	- $$tr(r)>0.5$$: the user prefers to save more time
	- $$tr(r)<0.5$$: the user prefers to reduce detour distance
	- detour: the actual detour distance

- Definition 8 Average Stisfaction:<br>
	$$AS_{S_i} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}Sa_{tr_j}$$

## Taxi Recommender System using Ridesharing Service
> Our main aim is to recommend a taxi T that wouldminimize its travel distance after satisfying all thepassenger’s queries that has arrived within a time interval.

### Overview
#### Definition
- Definiton 1 Query: 
	- `P.p`: pickup point of pessenger P
	- `P.d`: destination of passenger P
	- `P.p.t`: the time before which the taxi must reach the pickup point
	- `P.d.t`: the time before which the taxi must reach the destination

- Defination 2 Path:
	- the path of each taxi is dynamiclly updated 

- Definiton 3 Constraints:
	1. the current capacity is less than the maximum capacity
	2. the taxi can arrive at the pickup points and destination points whithin the predetermined time-interval after including P.p and P.d in its path

- Defination 4 Taxi Status:
	- current location, T.11-latitude, T.12-longitude
	- id of the taxi T.id
	- number of passengers in the taxi T.p

#### Dynamic Taxi-Ridesharing Problem
> Our aim is to recommend a taxi, which satisfies the passenger’s request with minimum increase in travel distance of that particular taxi.

#### Taxi Recommender System
- taxi-searching module
- apply time-window scheduling algorithm
	- calculate shortest path between the location of taxi and the location of the passenger
	- divide the city into small regions, each has a centroids $$C_i$$
	- 中心点之间的距离由 **[Haversine公式](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)** (球面距离计算公式)计算得出
		- C is the angular distance in radians - 弧度的角距离
		- a is the square of half the chord length - 两点之间弦长度一半的平方
	- $$L_i^d$$: the distance of $$L_i$$ from all other locations in ascending order
	- $$L_i^t$$: the taxi-id T.id near to the given location $$L_i$$

### Taxi-searching Algorithm
#### Single-side Taxi Searching
> The main concept of this searching is that we search from single-side. We select all the regions near to Lo.

select a taxi if it can reach the passenger within the time-limit: <br>
$$t_{curr} + t_{il} \leq P.p.t$$

#### Dual-side Taxi Searching
> It is a bidirectional searching algorithm. In this searching algorithm we search from both source side aswell as destination side simultaneously.

$$t_{curr} + t_{io} \leq Po.p.t$$

$$t_{curr} + t_{iD} \leq PD.p.t$$

### Taxi-scheduling
> The purpose of the scheduling is to properly schedule the route of a taxi so that the total distance travelled by the taxi could be minimized.

- attend n number of queries within a time window t;
- calculate the distance of current query from a filled taxi;
- If this distance comes out to be less than the previously attended query, then the current query is assigned the given taxi.

### Pricing Scheme
1. taxi fare per kilometre is higher for multiple passengers than for a single passenger, this property is beneficial for the driver
2. the taxi fare distribution is even among all the passengers; as a result, if more people share a taxiride,then each individual pays less for the ride

- `r`: the taxi-fare per kilometre
- `k`: the initial fare parameter
- `d1*r`: the initial fare of distance d1 whithout ridesharing
- `?` fare per individual is calculated as below:<br>
$$Individual\_fare = r*d1 + \frac{(r+1.5)*d_{1-10}}{m_{1-10}}+\frac{(r+1.2)*d_{11-30}}{m_{11-30}}+\frac{(r+1.2-(dc-30)/10^4)*d_{30-}}{m_{30-}}$$
- `?` total profit for taxi drivers is calculated as below:<br>
$$Total\_profit = r*D_n +(r+1.5)*d_{1-10}+(r+1.2)*d_{11-30}+(r+1.2-(d_c-1.65)/10^4)*d_{30-}$$
