# 城市级实时拼车问题

##  ABSTRACT
- propose and develop a taxi-sharing system
	- a taxi searching algorithm based on spatio-temporal index
	- a scheduling process selecting the most satisfied taxi

##  1 INTRODUCTION
- Real-time taxi-sharing has not been well explored.
- Real-time-taxi-sharing is more challenging due to the dynamic changes in both ride requests and taxi positions.
- Compared to existing carpooling systems, this model considers more practical constraints, such as time windows, capacity and monetary constraints.
- This paper's contributions:
	- propose and develop a taxi-sharing system using the mobile-cloud architecture
		- a spatio-temporal indexing structure
		- a taxi searching algorithm
		- a scheduling algorithm
	- considers and models monetary constraints in ridesharing
		- passengers will pay less and drivers can make more
	- perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of this system
- This paper's structure:
	- Section 2: formally describe the real-time-ride-sharing problem
	- Section 3: overview the architecture of the system
	- Section 4: describe the index of taxis and taxi searching algorithm
	- Section 5: describe the scheduling process
	- Section 6: evaluation 
	- Section 7: related work

## 2 RTTS PROBLEM

###  2.1 Data Model
- Ride Request

label | meaning | label | meaning
------|---------|-------|--------
Q     | ride request 			|Q.pw.l	| latest pick up time
Q.t   | timestamp				|Q.d   	| destination point
Q.o   | origin point			|Q.dw  	| expected delivery time
Q.pw  | expected pickup time	|Q.dw.e	| earlyest delivery time
Q.pw.e| earlyest pickup time	|Q.dw.l	| latest delivery time

- Taxi Status

label | meaning 
------|---------
V.ID  | taxi's unique identifier
V.t   | status's timestamp
V.l   | current geographical location
V.s   | current schedule of V
V.r   | current projected route of V

<b>V.s</b> : a temporally-ordered sequence of origin points and destination points, such as Q1.o, Q2.o, Q1.d...

- Qi.o should proceeds Qi.d
- Qi.o should not only exist in the sequence

<b>V.r</b> : a sequence of road network
 
###  2.2 Constraints
- Vehicle Capacity
make sure that the number of passengers is less than the number of taxi seats

- Time Window
all passengers should be able to depart from the origin point and arrive at the destination point during the pickup and delivery time window

- Monetary 
passengers should pay less and drivers should earn more

###  2.3 Objective Function & Problem Definition
- definition of the optimal taxi<br/>
satisfy Q with minimum increase in V's scheduled travel distance

- feature of this problem<br/>
	- the real-time taxi-sharing problem inherently resembles a greedy problem
	- the problem of minimizing the total travel distance of all taxis is NP-C

##  4 TAXI SEARCHING
###  4.1 Index of Taxis
> The spatio-temporal index of taixs is built for speeding up the taxi searching process. 

- parttion the road network using a grid


- choose the road network node which is closeest to the geographical center of the grid cell as the anchor node<br/>

![](https://ws2.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNc79gy1fqp34qteiqj309z09maai.jpg)

- compute the distance between grid i and grid j, denoted by $$d_{ij}$$

- compute the travel time between grid i and grid j, denoted by $$t_{ij}$$

- in this paper, $$d_{ij}$$ and $$t_{ij}$$ are calculated only once

- the distance betweeen two girds is approximated by the distance between two corresponding anchor nodes

- each gird maintains three lists:
	- a temporally-ordered grid list $$g_i.l_c^t$$, the list of other girds sorted in ascending order of the travel time from these grids to $$g_i$$

	- a spatially-order grid cell list $$g_i.l_c^s$$, the list of other grids sorted on ascending order of the travel distance from these grids to $$g_i$$

	- a taxi list list $$g_i.l_v$$, records the IDs of all taxis which are scheduled to enter $$g_i$$ in near future, each taxi IS is tagged with a timestamp $$t_a$$ indicating when the taxi will enter the grid cell, all taxis in the list are sorted in ascending order of associated timestamp $$t_a$$, $$V_j$$ is removed from list when $$V_j$$ leaves $$g_i$$, $$V_k$$ is inserted into list when it is newly scheduled to enter $$g_i$$.
   

###  4.2 Searching Algorithm
####  4.2.1 Single-Side Taxi Searching
Any other arbitrary grid cell $$g_i$$ is selected if it meets Eq.(1): 

$$t_{i7}+t_{cur} \leq Q.pw.l \tag{1}$$

The single-side algorithm simply tests all grids in the temporally-ordered grid cell list and find the first grid $$g_f$$ which fails to hold Eq.(1). Taxis in grids before $$g_i$$ are selected as candidate taxis.

Shortcomings: only considers taxis currently "near" the pickup point and the number of candidate taxis could be large which would lead to large computation cost;

####  4.2.2 Dual-Side Taxi Searching
Any other arbitrary grid cell $$g_i$$ is selected if it both hold Eq.(1) and Eq.(2): 

$$t_{cur}+t_{j2} \leq Q.dw.l \tag{2}$$

Shortcomings: may
